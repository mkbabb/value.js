# GLASSUI-T-ASKS — the value.js Tranche T packet series (P1–P10, + the KF note)

**To**: the glass-ui BG/BH inbox (`tranche/BG` live → the joint BG/BH **5.0.0**). **From**:
value.js Tranche T.
**Provenance**: `value.js docs/tranches/T/audit/SYNTHESIS.md §4` (the converged spec,
AS-AMENDED pass-2 `2a38c11`), transcribed verbatim; the routing/evidence census is
`audit/lanes/t-request-packets.md` (SHAPE + producer-root/joint/demo-only) on the forensics of
`t-glassui-current.md` (the 14-open-ask ground truth) + `t-glassui-forward.md` (the BG/BH
freeze gates) + the named finding lanes. The S letters this succeeds:
`S/letters/GLASSUI-S-ASKS.md` (L1–L18) + `-ADDENDUM-2026-07-05.md` (A1–A7 / L19 / L20).
**Verified glass-ui HEAD**: `d25ce9c1` (branch `tranche/BG`, npm **4.2.0**; **stamped at dispatch
2026-07-10** — the load-bearing cites re-verified live at this HEAD, see the `## Dispatch stamp`
section below. Authoring stamps: the fleet census cited `file:line` at **`19ddbd71`**; the
corpus-completion observation was **`6605e1dd`** 2026-07-09 — the producer moves daily,
~10-minute cadence on `tranche/BG`: HEAD advanced `f9c2d66a`→`d25ce9c1` DURING this dispatch,
proving the corollary).
**Status**: AUTHORED — **dispatch happens AT the T ratification (W0-1; the Q7 default:
immediately, not held for the BG frontier to quiet)**. [AMENDED-AT-HARDENING — h-packets
H-PKT-1: the precise freeze state] The WS12 `BH.B2.1-swap` export-regen has NOT run — `goo-blob`
is still in the export map (no `./blob`, no `/blob/config`) — so the W-1/W-2 freeze windows are
OPEN but they are the LAST window; NOTE the WS12 CSS-MINIFY + GATE-FAMILY-CONSOLIDATE waves DID
land (`ee382861`/`a900a71f`, 2026-07-05), so P2/PKT-1 and P8/A6 are claims about a POST-minify
dist — re-verified on a fresh `../glass-ui` build at dispatch (G-CUR-1). The W-3 behavior
packets have the widest window and the most value landing early — value.js sees them live via
the `file:` pin, which unblocks T's own consuming waves.

**HEAD-stamp corollary (binding on the dispatcher, the S-letter §16 discipline)**: the
dispatching agent **re-stamps the verified glass-ui HEAD at dispatch** and re-verifies every
load-bearing `file:line` below against the CURRENT tree (the S precedent: the aurora tree moved
under the letter once already — `glass-aurora/shaders/` → `aurora/constants/shaders/`).

**Letter discipline** (SYNTHESIS §4, verbatim): asks only — **T touches ZERO glass-ui files**
(the foreign-tree fence; E-2 speaks in packets); every item cites its evidence lane, which
carries `file:line` in the producer tree; three disposition classes kept distinct — **NEW** /
**RE-ASK-by-name** (the W-DESHADCN fold did NOT deliver — delivery ≠ disposition) /
**VERIFY-AT-CUT**. **Consolidation law (E-3)**: the letter reads as this handful of gestalt
packets, never 30 line items; PRM-expand routes to keyframes (§KF), never the glass-ui packet.

---

## The timing windows (t-glassui-forward §1 — the gates every packet must respect)

A packet that misses its gate becomes a post-5.0.0 minor — a second break event the owner's
one-migration edict forbids (`BH/PLAN.md §2-#4`).

| # | Gate | Freezes | The packets bound |
|---|---|---|---|
| **W-1** | the WS12 `BH.B2.1-swap` export-regen freeze (the regen has NOT run at authoring — verified via the export map, not the workstream label [AMENDED-AT-HARDENING]) | the published subpath/export SET | **P9-J1** (Blob rename in the regen input) · **P9-J2** (L20 `/blob/config`) · **P6's exported HERO preset** |
| **W-2** | B4e MIGRATION authoring freeze | the 203-row MIGRATION table + every rename/token-retire ROW | **P9-J3/J4** · any P3/P10 rung that RENAMES a token |
| **W-3** | the F-family behavior waves (rolling, pre-WS12) | src-level behavior — visible LIVE to value.js via the `file:` pin | **P1–P8, P10** (land early = T's consuming waves unblock sooner) |
| **W-4** | the joint 5.0.0 tag | everything (the npm `^4→^5` event) | the VERIFY-AT-CUT walk = value.js T.W7 (a REBUILT dist against a stamped HEAD) |

### §KF — the keyframes note (a SEPARATE dispatch to the keyframes.js inbox — the consolidation law: never folded into the glass-ui packet)

| # | Ask | Class |
|---|---|---|
| **KF** | **PRM-expand**: `managed-play.ts:46-60` (`springPlay`) — the PRM arm at **`:48`** (`withReducedMotion(spring.respectReducedMotion, () => spring.snap(), …)`) routes through `snap()`→`_snapSettled()`→`emit()` (`progress.ts:230-239` + `:461-466`), which iterates the `.subscribe()` `subscribers` SET ONLY — **never the `.play(onFrame)` single-callback `_onFrame`** (set at `managed-play.ts:47`, declared `progress.ts:125`) — so `.play()` consumers get NO settled frame under an active reduced-motion query; contrast the NON-PRM settled branch (`managed-play.ts:53-55`) which DOES `onFrame?.(spring.value, spring.velocity)`. The asymmetric omission is the defect; the one-line cure = the PRM branch emits `onFrame` too. **Re-verified STILL LIVE at keyframes 5.2.0 / HEAD `e3d0ae5` (2026-07-10)** — the S-era `:48-59` cite holds, line-refreshed; glass-ui's dock PRM-expand defect roots here. Dispatched SEPARATELY to the keyframes.js inbox (`../keyframes.js docs/tranches/T/VALUEJS-KF-PRM-EXPAND-2026-07-09.md` — see the `## Dispatch stamp`) | RE-CITE (current line numbers, re-stamped at dispatch; **STILL LIVE — NOT discharged**) |

---

## The hard-seam map (books never gates — NO T wave is blocked on a packet; every seam is an EXPECTED-RED row or a booked swap, all walked at T.W7)

- **PKT-1 (P2)** → the O-16 computed-cascade census R1 row (bare-utility default) stays
  **EXPECTED-RED carrying this packet's cite** until the fix lands; goes live the day it does.
  NO demo cascade arms-race in the interim.
- **PKT-3 (P2)** → T.W5 Tranche B (the R6/R7 compositor collapses) is left UNTOUCHED — never
  retimed on layout properties — until the recipe lands (PI-5).
- **P1 GAP-ARM** → the demo half (W2-1 hydration-first) is **NOT producer-gated** and cures the
  visible pink alone; the producer replay is re-verified at W7. **P1 pointer honesty (F-10)** →
  the W2-5 pointer retune is DEFERRED until it lands.
- **P3 rungs** → W3-1 (`--well-bg`), W3-3 (search seat), W3-4 (feather/rest-floor knobs) land
  demo interims with **booked swaps** (fire at W7, or earlier via the file:-pin).
- **P5 letter-rail** → W4-4 lands the interim seal-recipe ring; booked swap.
- **P6 `settled` seam / engine pose** → W4-5's park stays wall-clock, W2-4's emerge rides the
  FSM's existing `emerging` state; both booked swaps. The HERO preset is W-1-bound.
- **P7 autoplay door** → W6-3's regex-drive is deleted the day the declarative door lands;
  the `.underline-tabs` MARKER retire-check runs at W7.
- **P8 A6/CC-1** → the demo `backdrop-filter:none` MARKER retires the day A6 is fixed; the two
  bare `.glass-wash` sites paint their rung the day CC-1 is fixed.
- **P4 tabs** → O-8 (indicator ≡ active-button box) goes live at W7, post-adopt.

**Q16 candidates (flagged, producer's call — not resolved here)**: `EmptyState` + the picker
action controls as glass-ui primitives; until answered, `EmptyState` lifts to a shared demo
atom and the action controls stay picker exports via the hardened barrel. [AMENDED-AT-HARDENING
— h-packets H-PKT-3: two more Q16-class riders restored from t-misc-elements F2/F3] **+ the
hue-carrying primary tier** (T-16 — "prominence = tint, not size" is glass-ui's own comment;
the demo must not costume the button locally) **+ the dock status-lamp primitive** (T-9 — the
lamp is candidate dock vocabulary; if glass-ui grows one, the demo consumes it at the root).

## Verify-at-cut rows (recorded, not re-booked — walked at value.js T.W7)

L1 (WebKit aurora GLSL, fixed `d03579a1`) · L3 (zombie rAF → `useRAFLoop`, `b01d0556`) · L18
(Select chevron, `d03579a1`) · F9.R1 (`uSatColor[]` shade set, `5df908ae`) / F9.R8 (affect/
pointer/SDF, `e0320565`) · L19-base (aurora pointer door, consumed S.W6-7) ·
W-AUR-IMAGE-SOURCE · A4-consumed.

**The demo-only register** (primitives EXIST — cited, never re-asked): T-14 liquid tokens ship
· T-28's ghost-stroke mechanism ships · T-17 = Select composition · T-23's `veil-surface`
register ships (the knobs, not the register, are P3) · T-20's `layout:"full"` is orthogonal to
the D1 defect (the packet stands) · T-29 is DEMO-owned (`Dock.vue` is a value.js file; NOT a
portal ask).

---

## Dispatch protocol (binding on the W0-1 dispatcher)

1. **Dispatch AT ratification, not before** (E-6: development-only until the `T.md §12` gate
   rules; then W0-1 fires immediately per Q7). **P9 is named FIRST** in the transmitted letter.
2. **Re-stamp**: replace `<RE-STAMP AT DISPATCH>` with the verified `tranche/BG` HEAD;
   re-verify P1's `useAurora.ts` cites, PKT-1's dist emission, and P3's F2.R1 paint state
   against the CURRENT tree; record the stamp in a `## Dispatch stamp` section (the S-letter
   shape).
3. **Dist-rebuild discipline (G-CUR-1)**: the consumed dist is a gitignored LOCAL build with no
   content-addressed fence — any claim about "what ships" is made against a fresh
   `cd ../glass-ui && npm run build`, never the version label.
4. **Delivery ≠ disposition**: a producer reply that folds an ask onto another workstream is
   not a discharge — P7's rows stay open until source-verified landed at HEAD (that is how L8
   reached its 5th booking).
5. **Record the dispatch** in `PROGRESS.md` (event-log row + producer-inbox cite = the
   value.js-side `## Dispatch stamp` + PROGRESS row — the RULED reading, h-exec-w0 M1), per the
   W0-1 gate: dispatch record + acked-or-recorded.
6. **Re-cut Q-sensitive rows to the RATIFIED outcomes before transmitting** [AMENDED-AT-HARDENING
   — h-refine-console F-9]: P5's ring-contract membership per Q12 (default: `--dock-ring` +
   letter-rail; the seal-rim leg only if the fitted arm ruled); one line noting the P7
   description-lane contract is Q5-outcome-independent (the producer never waits on Q5).
7. **DECLINE dispositions (recorded at first producer response, never discovered at the W9 walk)**
   [AMENDED-AT-HARDENING — h-gaps G-5]: P3/P5 → the demo interim BECOMES PERMANENT (recorded);
   **P4/T-20 → ESCALATE TO THE OWNER** (a two-repo taste conflict is the owner's call — T-20 has
   no demo interim and E-2 forbids a fork); P6 row-F → the FSM `emerging` state is already the
   sanctioned terminal (no loss).

## Dispatch stamp (W0-1 — 2026-07-10; the S-letter §16 shape)

**Stamped HEAD**: glass-ui `d25ce9c1` (branch `tranche/BG`, npm **4.2.0**) · keyframes.js
`e3d0ae5` (branch `tranche-u-dev`, npm **5.2.0**). The producer moved DURING dispatch
(`f9c2d66a`→`d25ce9c1`, ~10-min cadence) — the HEAD-stamp corollary held in real time; the
cites below are re-verified at `d25ce9c1`.

**Re-verified load-bearing cites (protocol step 2, against the CURRENT tree):**

- **P1 GAP-ARM — STILL LIVE.** `useAurora.ts` (`src/components/custom/aurora/composables/`):
  `armRuntime()` (`:210`) calls `inst.arm()` (`:214`), then wires `stopWatch = watch(getCfg,
  (next) => inst?.update(next), { deep: true })` at **`:228` — WITHOUT `immediate:true`**;
  deferred construction is `inst = createAurora(canvas, getCfg(), …)` at **`:262`**. No honest
  `inst.update(getCfg())` fires between construct (`:262`) and arm (`:214`), so a config change
  in that window is not replayed onto the armed instance. The `:228/:262` cite in P1 stands
  (arm now explicitly at `:214`); the ask is NOT discharged.
- **PKT-1 (P2) — dist-level, G-CUR-1.** `grep default-transition-duration src/**/*.css` = ZERO
  hits at `d25ce9c1`; the `--default-transition-duration:150ms` re-declaration is a BUILD
  emission (dist `components.css` under `layer(components)`), not a source token — consistent
  with the letter's "claims about a POST-minify dist." Verified against the dist per G-CUR-1 (a
  fresh `cd ../glass-ui && npm run build`, never the version label) at the W7 verify-at-cut walk;
  the ask stands as a dist claim, O-16 R1 carries it EXPECTED-RED.
- **P3 A1/A2 F2.R1 — DISCHARGED (VERIFY-AT-CUT holds).** Paint-closed at glass-ui `300a30fb`
  ("BG paint (BG.W-DARK-READABILITY-REPAIR): dual-engine PASS Chrome+Safari both modes → DONE");
  re-confirm on a fresh 5.0.0 rebuild at dispatch/W7 per the letter.
- **P9 W-1/W-2 freeze windows — OPEN (the LAST window).** The export map at `d25ce9c1` still
  carries `./goo-blob`, with **NO `./blob`** and **NO `./blob/config`** — the WS12
  `BH.B2.1-swap` export-regen has NOT run. P9-J1 (Blob rename in the regen input) and P9-J2 (L20
  `/blob/config`) must land before B2.1-swap freezes. `./easing` + `./styles/fonts` +
  `./configurator` present (P9-J3 twin + P10 rungs verify against BG/BH at authoring).
- **§KF PRM-expand — STILL LIVE, line-refreshed (NOT discharged).** See the §KF row: at
  keyframes 5.2.0 the `springPlay` PRM branch (`managed-play.ts:48`) emits via
  `_snapSettled().emit()` to the `.subscribe()` `subscribers` set ONLY, never the `.play(onFrame)`
  `_onFrame` channel; the non-PRM settled branch (`managed-play.ts:53-55`) emits `onFrame`
  directly — the PRM branch's asymmetric omission is the defect. Routed SEPARATELY (below).

**Q-sensitive rows confirmed at the RATIFIED outcomes (protocol step 6, RATIFICATION-2026-07-09
§1):** P5 ring-contract = **`--dock-ring` L13 + letter-rail**, the seal-rim leg DEAD under Q12's
default ABROGATE (already cut in-letter) · P7 Select description-lane contract is
**Q5-outcome-independent** (the producer never waits on Q5) · P10 size-station cites **Q11a** (the
producer typography ladder is the sizing AUTHORITY; ×φ = two token steps; the consumer mints no
sizes) · Q5's chip arm is DEAD for T-10 (P-row grammar unchanged; survives only where T-17 earns
it). No re-cut owed — the letter was authored post-fold and already carries these.

**The dispatch record (W0-1 gate — the M1 ruling: the value.js-SIDE record IS the gate; a
glass-ui-side relay commit is a producer/maintainer action, never this gate's artefact):**

- **glass-ui inbox (the maintainer relay, executed now):**
  `../glass-ui/docs/tranches/BG/coordination/VALUEJS-T-ASKS-2026-07-09.md` — path-scoped
  single-file commit **`398b7b4d`** on `tranche/BG`, pushed to `origin/tranche/BG` (fast-forward
  `9b891736..398b7b4d`, no force; parent `606c19ff` — HEAD had advanced past the `d25ce9c1` stamp
  during dispatch; the producer's uncommitted paint PNGs were left untouched). The §KF ask is
  trimmed to a routing pointer there (the consolidation law: PRM-expand is never folded into the
  glass-ui packet).
- **keyframes.js inbox (the separate §KF dispatch):**
  `../keyframes.js/docs/tranches/T/VALUEJS-KF-PRM-EXPAND-2026-07-09.md` — path-scoped single-file
  commit **`ad65733`** on `tranche-u-dev`, pushed to `origin/tranche-u-dev` (fast-forward
  `e3d0ae5..ad65733`, no force).
- **value.js-side record:** this `## Dispatch stamp` section + the `PROGRESS.md` event-log row +
  the Cross-repo dispatch-points table flipped to DISPATCHED. This is the closeable W0-1 artefact
  per the amended Hard-gate item 1; an ack is a bonus, never waited on.
