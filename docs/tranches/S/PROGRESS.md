# S — PROGRESS

**Status board.** S is **RATIFIED 2026-07-05 — dispatch OPEN.** The owner ruled on all 11
`S.md §12` rows; the encoding of record is `audit/RATIFICATION-2026-07-05.md` (§0 verbatim
owner text wins), with the 14 `audit/seeds/SEEDS.md` riders folded into the wave docs and the
2 producer findings folded into the glass-ui letter (L17/L18). The convergence loop is CLOSED
(4 passes, **100/98·zero-mustFix CONVERGED**, `audit/CONVERGENCE.md`); **zero implementation
commits exist**. The governing specification is `audit/SYNTHESIS.md` (AMENDED-AT-PASS-4 + tail)
as amended BY the ratification encoding + SEEDS riders; where any corpus doc could diverge,
**the spec (as so amended) wins**.

**Dispatch gate: the §12 ratification gate is CLOSED; waves dispatch per the §3.1 DAG** (each
wave gated on its DAG deps only). The GLASSUI-S-ASKS letter dispatches now (at-ratification
timing; the dispatcher re-stamps the verified HEAD).

**Substrate (verified 2026-07-04):**
- Branch `tranche-q` @ `46ff8d3`, value.js **2.0.1** on the registry (2.0.0 `96f124d` tagged;
  2.0.1 = the parse-that `^1.0.0` re-pin, `a7eabcc`). R CLOSED `complete_with_misses` — the
  X1/X2 maintainer-on-host residuals carry as S books (verified/probed at W0-3).
- Siblings: glass-ui `file:`-dep, **`tranche/BG` LIVE → 5.0.0** (CI pinned to `tranche/BG` per
  R.W7 `102b37b`; the producer commits ~every 10 minutes — every live probe cites its HEAD) ·
  keyframes.js 5.1.0 (S-impl in flight) · parse-that **1.0.0** · fourier-analysis at tranche N.
- The synthesis was authored at `b5f94bc`; the corpus is stamped at `46ff8d3` (delta =
  S convergence-loop docs only; zero source drift).

## Round structure

```
round 0:  S.W0 substrate (dev truth + oracle floor + hygiene)
round 1:  S.W1 library 3.0.0 ∥ S.W2 transposition
round 2:  S.W3 perf ∥ S.W4 picker+docs
round 3:  S.W5 suffusion II ∥ S.W6 atmosphere+hero
round 4:  S.W7 dock+shell        (⊣ W1 + W3; round barrier after W5 ∥ W6 close)
close:    S.W9
S.W8 (5.0.0 adopt) — trigger-gated on the BG/BH joint cut; slots into whatever round is
current when it fires; NOT on the critical path (books never gates).
```

Intra-round ordering (binding, `S.md §3.1`): W1-6's `safeAccentCssString` FIRST in W1; W2-2 and
W2-7 LAST in W2; single-writer on `ColorPicker.vue` in round 2 (W4-2 first, W3-4 rebases).

## Cross-repo dispatch points

| Event | When | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **GLASSUI-S-ASKS letter** (L1..L18; L1/L3/L4 P0 — L1 = the WebKit aurora shader compile; hard-gate map L2→W6-2/-3, L4→W7-3, L1→W6-5; ratification fold: L17 `Blob` rename · L18 Select chevron · the L5 co-rebuild upgrade + full-presence constraint + pointer-shaping append) | **at S ratification — NOW DUE** (early — the L1/L2/L4 items need the maximum producer window before rounds 3–4; L12 is time-sensitive: before BH.B4e authors the 203-row MIGRATION table). The dispatcher **re-stamps the verified glass-ui HEAD at dispatch** (the letter carries the literal `<RE-STAMP AT DISPATCH>` placeholder; `a633784f` was the pass-2 stamp; `c03ab942` the pass-3 stamp — the producer moves daily) | **AUTHORED + RATIFICATION-FOLDED** — `letters/GLASSUI-S-ASKS.md`, dispatch-ready |
| **parse-that PT-E letter** (scoped per-parse diagnostics HIGH · combinator-inference MED · Pratt-stays-dormant record) | S.W1, item W1-9 (paired with the value.js-side decision on the dead `expected` field) | **AUTHORED** — `letters/PARSE-THAT-PT-E.md` |
| **kf courtesy note** (canonical `resolveEasing` home; EasingPicker loop seam ↔ kf Oscillator is glass-ui↔kf coordination) | with the W1 3.0.0 cut | **AUTHORED** — `letters/KF-COURTESY.md` |
| fourier | — | nothing new (FN charter delivered at R.W6; CH-13 quiescence book unchanged) |

## Event log

| Date | Event |
|---|---|
| 2026-07-04 | 33-lane audit fleet completed against the live tree (`audit/lanes/`, ~4.5M tokens, 1,842 tool calls, 0 errors); all 24 owner findings root-caused |
| 2026-07-04 | **Convergence loop CLOSED** (`46ff8d3`): pass 1 (86/72, 13 mustFix) → pass 2 (95.7/92; `2fe2b48`) → pass 3 (99.5/97; `8e4b1d4`) → pass 4 **100/98·zero-mustFix** + tail dissents discharged (`f3d93c3`). `audit/SYNTHESIS.md` (AMENDED-AT-PASS-4 + tail) is the converged, governing specification; record at `audit/CONVERGENCE.md`. Notable in-loop flips: Q4 → EXCISE; W1-8 widened to the census's full SPLIT-WORTHY set; W3-9 (CSS gate) minted; W5 laned; L1 re-pinned to the verified producer HEAD |
| 2026-07-04 | **Tranche S corpus authored**: `S.md` charter + this board + `waves/S.W0.md`..`waves/S.W9.md` + `letters/{GLASSUI-S-ASKS,PARSE-THAT-PT-E,KF-COURTESY}.md`. **Status: DEVELOPMENT COMPLETE — dispatch gate OPEN awaiting the `S.md §12` owner ratification (Q1–Q11)** |
| 2026-07-04 | **Prototype-seed fleet complete** (`wf_01c28a82-3c2`; 5/5 worktree seeds, batches of 3; the original loop's step 3): `w0-dev-backend` VIABLE · `w2-usecolorpipeline` VIABLE_WITH_AMENDMENTS · `w4-title-component` VIABLE_WITH_AMENDMENTS · `w7-wax-seal` VIABLE · `w6-blob-redress` VIABLE_WITH_AMENDMENTS. 14 ratification-time riders + 2 net-new producer findings (Select chevron dead code; GooBlob pointer shaping → L5) recorded in `audit/seeds/SEEDS.md`; GAP-1 (`uSatColor[]` absent) now dist-confirmed. Prototype code in `audit/seeds/*.patch` only — nothing landed on mainline. **S is DEVELOPED + PROTOTYPED — awaiting the §12 ratification** |
| 2026-07-05 | **OWNER RATIFICATION — the §12 gate CLOSES; dispatch OPEN** (encoding of record: `audit/RATIFICATION-2026-07-05.md`; §0 verbatim owner text wins). All 11 rows ruled: 6 defaults ratified as speced (Q1 WIRE-full-idiomatic · Q3 EXCISE-broadened · Q4 EXCISE · Q5 YES · Q6 TRUE-EMPTY-only · Q11 YES-in-S), **5 flips/amplifications by name**: **Q2** (`logerp` reorder lands W1 NOW, no shim → **the W1 cut becomes 3.0.0**, cascaded corpus-wide by name; the §13 "breaking-changes-always → cut the major" standing precept minted) · **Q7** (blob FULL PRESENCE at every viewport + the W0-8 SOTA-assay/archaeology genesis brief + the GooBlob→`Blob` producer rename, letter L17/W8 adopt) · **Q8** (R-4 raytrace builds NOW at W1-10, Ottosson analytical as oracle — book DISCHARGED) · **Q9** (widened: +Jzazbz at W1-11) · **Q10** (mix animation re-graded to first-principles REPLACE — Safari-true by construction, NO fallback). The 14 SEEDS.md riders folded into W0-1/W2-1/W4-1/W6-4/W7-1+gate; the 2 producer findings → letter L18 + the L5 append; W0-9 dependency-excision ledger added (§2.4).
