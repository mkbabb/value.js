                 lane's `@ms` offset (X.KF.W13V.s2). The stage therefore keeps
                 unlabelled lanes, an index at most: the master-clock ruler
                 (SequenceAxis) and the stage playhead (SequencePlayhead) are
                 deleted with their `@ms` labels, so two adjacent regions no longer
                 compete as the timing primary (and the playhead's grid-row and
                 width defects, KFA-49 · KFA-105 · KFA-219 · UIA-KF-030 · UIA-KF-314,
                 leave with it). The lanes keep the time geometry the pane draws:
                 each traveller RESTS on its start gate (`--row-start`) and arrives at
                 its own end time (`--row-span`, UIA-KF-214), so the stagger reads as
                 a diagonal cascade at every instant. The Card is the only frame
