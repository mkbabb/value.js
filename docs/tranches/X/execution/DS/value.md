# X-DS — value.js: pass receipts

Wave: `waves/X-DS.md` (COHESION §0ej, refined at §0ek). App: value.js, `demo/**` (not `demo/@/components/ui/**`), branch `tranche-u`. Canon: `execution/DS/value-canon.md`. Frames: `evidence/DS/value/pass-NN/`.

Note: the first pass-1 cure (`36adcc1ff`, critic rows V1-xx) cites "recorded in execution/DS/value.md" for its refusals (V1-07, V1-12, V1-21 plate half, V1-25, V1-26). This file did not exist until now; those refusals live only in that commit body.

### pass 1

This receipt covers the cure of the pass-1 critic's rows **V1C-01 … V1C-11** (consumer) and **V1C-G1 … G4** (glass), judged after `36adcc1ff`.

**Commits.** value.js `082e1abbd` (the cure, 14 files) and `f3280eefa` (AFTER frames, census, probes, e2e listings).

**Consumer findings, cured at the root.**

| id | cure | measured |
|---|---|---|
| V1C-01 | `utils.css` THE WELL INK: inside `.dashed-well`, `.console-well`, `.search-seated` and `[data-generate-plate]`, `--muted-foreground` is `--ink-muted` one golden step (38.2%) toward `--foreground`. One token rule; every `text-muted-foreground`, placeholder and icon in a well follows it. Bare `--ink-muted` (the critic's suggestion) measured 3.7–3.9:1 on the dark well, because the well's own 8% foreground wash moves the ground toward the ink. | Painted-ground contrast, HEAD → cure (`cure-probe-before/after.json`). Light: well caption 1.99 → 4.69, search placeholder 2.09 → 4.91, generate seed 1.55 → 3.64. Dark: 5.12 → 5.19, 4.87 → 5.00, 5.91 → 5.99. |
| V1C-03 | `App.vue` `.route-title`: uppercase and 0.06em tracking are gone. The title stays visible for A5 and reads in sentence case ("Atmosphere"). Not moved into the pane's title row. | `text-transform: none`, `letter-spacing: normal` |
| V1C-04 | Section heads take the app's one head: `ConfigSliderPane` sections are `h3.font-display.text-subheading` (Fraunces 600, sentence case: "Field", "Geometry" …), and Mix's Selected, Result and From palettes take the same classes. Inline field labels take glass `Label` (the voice of "Preset"/"Type"): Aurora's Harmony, Arrangement, Medium and Motion, and Gradient's Direction. Glass's `.section-label` utility is not restyled. | Field: Fraunces 600, no transform; Harmony: Plus Jakarta Sans 500 |
| V1C-05 | `AuroraPane`: `.aurora-form` is one grid (`max-content minmax(0,1fr)`), with the rows as `display: contents`. | trigger x at 1440: 298/308/349/298 → 324 ×4 (both themes) |
| V1C-06 | `ConfigSliderPane`: glass's default range variant replaces `spectrum`. The range is the value, inked with `--ink-muted` through `--slider-range-bg`. The unfilled track keeps glass's quiet default, with no override. | range 731 of 962px at Color Energy 0.76; o18 range leg ≥3:1, light and dark, ×2 |
| V1C-07 | `GenerateControls`: the header `PaletteColorStrip` is removed; the title opens the plate. | 0 strips in the plate |
| V1C-08 | `ExtractControls`: with nothing developed, the K rail stands at glass's `sm` rung (12px, the same as kC). It grows to 24px only when it carries the ramp. The row keeps its 24px band. **Partly cured:** the rail keeps the certified track ink, not the "quiet tone" the critic asked for. A quiet tone would reopen the owner's "un-readable sliders" (t33-audit-11) and fail O-18 T-44a's ≥3:1 extract-k-rail leg. | rail 24 → 12px, kC 12px |
| V1C-09 | Picker seat: one `--spectrum-stamp` (8px) is read by the stamp and the seat. The spectrum→console gap is `8px + 1rem`. The field gives up the stamp's width on its right, so the stamp ends on the console's edge. The stamp is canon and stays. | gap 12 → 24px (16px breath under the stamp); stamp right 690 = console right 690; card edge 711 (1440). At 390: 359 = 359, card edge 374. |
| V1C-10 | `DockViewSelect` `--dock-ring`: the `0 0 8px` accent glow layer is removed; the width ring stays. O-59 stays the root ask. | one layer |
| V1C-11 | Generate's copied check takes `contrastInkFor(swatch)` instead of white with a `drop-shadow` filter. | no filter |

**Refused (owner-ruled), escalated for a ruling.**
- **V1C-02** (the Extract instrument face's idle pulse). The living, staggered pulse on that face is the owner's own overrule: T.md R12 **[OWNER-2026-07-11]**, "these shadow palettes … do not shimmer properly" (t33-audit-07), which names "LIVING staggered pulse (i × 0.12s)" for exactly the standing-instrument face, with PRM degrading it static. O-9's living leg asserts it. The later §0ek ruling ("idle shimmer, pulse or breathe that carries no state" is out) contradicts it. Choosing between the owner's two rulings is an owner decision, not a cure, so the pulse stays. The census's 14 consumer looping animations are all this face.

**Glass-owned, left honest-RED, not overridden.**
- **V1C-G1, G2, G4:** O-87 FLAT-LIGHTING (the rim stack, the hero bead's specular and double drop, the two-layer control fill and the hover specular).
- **V1C-G3:** O-88 DOCK-COLLAPSE-MOTION.

**Census** (`scripts/ds-census.mjs --widths 1440 --themes light,dark --settle 5000`, 9 routes). Both columns are served from clean worktrees at `9b05194d1`, each with a local api and mongod, so no dev-misconfigured state. They are like for like with each other, but not with the critic's `census.json`, which was served without an api.

| computed | HEAD (`census-before-head.json`) | cure (`census-after.json`) |
|---|---:|---:|
| consumer: box-shadow layers | 116 | 116 |
| consumer: backdrop blur | 18 | 18 |
| consumer: looping animations | 14 | 14 (V1C-02, refused) |
| glass: multi-layer elements | 86 | **154** |
| glass: inset-highlight layers | 174 | **310** |
| glass: backdrop blur | 42 | 110 |
| filter: drop-shadow (glass) | 8 | 8 |
| gradient fills on controls (glass) | 22 | 22 |
| verdict | RED | RED |

The glass rise is the 34 config scalars (3 on Atmosphere, 31 on Blob). With V1C-06 they render glass's scrubber range, `span.slider-range.glass-liquid-fill`, which carries the four-sided rim stack V1C-G1 already names (31 offenders per Blob page). The rule here is glass-first with no local override, so the rows are glass's to flatten at the 10.2.0 repin. **Flagged for the pass-2 critic:** this consumer choice puts more glass lighting on screen until that repin.

The static half is unchanged: the removed glow and filter lived in a JS string and a Tailwind `drop-shadow` utility, which the static scan does not count.

**Frames.** `evidence/DS/value/pass-01/`: 36 frames (9 routes × light/dark × 1440/390), headless real Chrome (`capture.mjs`), served from the cure worktree. The critic's own frames are in `pass-01/critic-2026-10-07/` (not this seat's).

**Gates.**
- **Type-check** (`vue-tsc` lib/demo/test + `tsc` e2e): 0 errors ×2.
- **vitest**, cure tree at `9b05194d1`: 1094/1101 ×2. HEAD alone fails the same 7 (`ink.test` ×5, `spectrum-luma` C-5, `reka-binding-idiom` NG-6). None touches a changed file. **Not GREEN, pre-existing.**
- **e2e**, the 19 specs that touch the changed surfaces (116 tests, smoke project, headless, workers 1, host load 50–100): cure run 1 33 failed / 83 passed; cure run 2 32 / 84; HEAD alone 33 / 83. 22 tests fail in both cure runs and on HEAD; they are pre-existing. Listings are in `v1c-gates/`.
  - Only two tests failed in both cure runs and not in the HEAD run: `views/gradient` "a grab is not a teleport" and "neighbour-crossing drag". Both sit at the 30 s budget (22–35 s). Isolated, they pass and fail on both trees: HEAD failed 1 of 4 runs, the cure failed 3 of 4 and later passed 3 of 4 at lower load. They are timeout flakes, not a functional break, and need a quiet-host read.
  - The directly affected legs are GREEN in both cure runs: O-18 config rows (text) and the re-aimed config range leg, light and dark; O-10d heading census; O-9 Extract instrument face; O-20 verb containment; page-load ×2.
  - **e2e is NOT ×2 GREEN** because of the pre-existing set.
- **Gate re-aimed (named, not a golden):** the O-18 config-track graphics leg measures `.slider-range` (the value's extent) instead of `.slider-track`, at the same 3:1 floor and on the same well. **No visual golden was re-baselined.**

**Instrument notes.**
- A vite dev server that shares `node_modules/.vite` with another server (`:9000` serves this tree for other seats) re-optimises under a running suite. The pane then crashes with "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'ce')", which reads as duplicate Vue. The fix is a worktree with its own `node_modules` directory (per-entry symlinks, private `.vite`).
- Without a local api, the "dev MISCONFIGURED" console error fails every zero-console-error test. This seat ran its own `mongod` (rs0, :27117) and api (:3473), and allowed both worktree origins.
- The scratchpad is shared with other sessions, and a file named `specs.txt` was overwritten mid-pass. Use unique names.

**For the pass-2 critic.**
- The config scalars now wear glass's liquid range rim (see the census). Judge whether `scrubber` is right for them before 10.2.0, or whether the rows should wait for glass.
- Light-scheme well text over a saturated aurora still measures below 4.5:1 at the generate seed (3.64). Pure `--foreground` measures 4.27 on that ground, so the ceiling is the plate's translucency.
- V1C-03's "better still" (seat the title in the pane's title row) was not done.
- V1C-02 waits on the owner.

### pass 2

This receipt covers the cure of the pass-2 critic's rows **V2C-01 … V2C-17**, judged after `02356e29d`.

**Commits.** value.js `ddd399786` (the cure, 11 files) and `2e605e5cb` (AFTER frames, census, probes, e2e listings).

**Consumer findings, cured at the root.**

| id | cure | measured (`pass-02/cure-probe-after.json`) |
|---|---|---|
| V2C-01 | `PalettesPane`: the body runs on glass's `FadingScroll` inside the row-following card, exactly as About does (end feather on, start feather off under the sticky veil; the `pane-scroll-fade` timeline host moves to the port). The row contract is untouched. The empty state no longer takes `grow`, and in this pane its plate padding starts at zero, so it sits under the "Start a new palette" well. | Browse 1440, both themes: card 362, content 416, mask on, feather 24px; message bottom 336 < feather start 338. The hint fades under the feather. Generate: card 405, message bottom 336. |
| V2C-02 | One scalar row: the name left, the value right in mono tabular figures, the track below (Direction's pattern). Extract K "Colors", kC "Chroma weight" and Generate's count "Colors" take visible glass `Label`s. The config console's `ConfiguratorRow` value moves to the row end at the mono-small rung (scoped `:deep`, layout only). Generate's slider is now named "Number of colors", which contains its visible name. | Every row: name left = track left, value right = track right, value above the track, `tabular-nums` (Atmosphere, Blob, Direction, K, kC, count). |
| V2C-03 | **Partly cured.** When the controls stand down (a run in flight, the camera open), the K rail and the kC track take glass's `--opacity-disabled`. The critic's premise did not hold: with no image the sliders are live. | No image: `data-disabled` false on both sliders, rail opacity 1, so the certified ink stays (O-18 T-44a, no re-aim needed). |
| V2C-06, V2C-09 | One scalar range ink, set once on glass's `--slider-range-bg` token at `:root` (`utils.css`, THE SCALAR RANGE INK): `--ink-muted` halfway toward the view accent `--primary`. It carries the identity hue, and in dark it lifts the bar off the flat mid-grey. `ConfigSliderPane` drops its local rule; Direction takes the token with no instance rule. The Direction readout sits at `plate-ink`. Only these two populations use glass's default range variant; the spectrum sliders do not read the token. | `ink-candidates.jsonl` (painted ground): light Atmosphere well `--ink-muted` 3.04, the mix 3.01; a mix toward the plate falls to 2.49 (23.6%) and 2.13 (38.2%), so the light bar cannot be lighter. Dark well: 3.28 → 5.04. O-18 config range leg GREEN ×2, light and dark. |
| V2C-07 | The easing curve name reads at `text-foreground`; the "1 → 2" index stays muted. | light: name rgb(28,25,23), index rgb(112,89,66) |
| V2C-08 | The CSS output wraps with `wrap-break-word`, not `break-all`. | `word-break: normal`, `overflow-wrap: break-word`; frames show breaks at spaces |
| V2C-12 | `.aurora-form` field column capped: `max-content minmax(0, 20rem)`. | triggers 320px (from about 890), all left at 324 |
| V2C-13 | One dash per affordance: `.dashed-well:has(.add-slot-ghost)` draws a 1px solid `--card-edge` hairline (`utils.css`, one rule). Mix's "Selected" and the current-palette well change; Extract's empty drop zone, which has no add-slot, keeps its dash. | Mix and My Palettes wells: `solid 1px` |
| V2C-14 | "Upload image" uses `font-display text-small`. | Fraunces 16.4px |
| V2C-17 | `.pane-scroll-fade.fading-scroll--y { --fade-scroll-width: 1.5rem }` (`PaneHeader.vue`, next to the scroll-host rule): the token is set once for the vertical pane ports, About and My Palettes. | feather 1.5rem (24px) on both |

**Not cured, escalated.**
- **V2C-05** (move the h1 into the pane title). This is a structural re-aim of X.W5.a gate A5, not a style cure. The `<main aria-labelledby="route-title">` relation and the `MAIN_PANE` fixture (`main:has(> h1#route-title)`, read by 64 spec files) both key on the shell's h1. The routed subject is not one pane on every route (Palettes, Mix and Blob seat the shared picker as the stage). An out-in pane swap would leave a moment with no h1, or two. The landmark name would also change from the schema label ("Home") to a pane sentence, and the mobile spec asserts "Home". It needs a named A5 ruling before a seat moves it. Until then the title stays as V1C-03 left it.
- **V2C-15** (the resting header veil). Owner-ruled Q9 / O-11 gate 1. Banked for an owner ruling under §0ek, as the critic asked.
- **V2C-16** (the "Palettes" ramp in light and dark). **DESIGN-RULING.** The ±40° fan is the ruled form (Q4/Q5), and `palettes-ramp.ts` records that "the PASTEL REGISTER inside this honest guard is the owner's T-56 bracket (P4-B1)… the owner rules the register." Measured: the title stops sit at the guarded live accent's lightness (light L 0.305, C 0.12 / 0.12 / 0.08; dark L 0.958, C 0.034 / 0.021 / 0.023). The walk keeps a stop that already clears 3:1 and never re-lifts its chroma. Re-seeding the title stops from the hue cusp would restore hue separation inside the 3:1 floor, but that is a change of register, so the owner rules it. Identity is untouched (§0dm).

**Glass-owned, held on O-87, not overridden.** V2C-04 (the floater's 9-layer stack and the down-left cartoon rung against the canon's down-right stamp), V2C-10 (a disabled seated capsule casting a float shadow), V2C-11 (the inactive Tabs ink on the composited track, and the plate-in-plate indicator).

**Census** (`scripts/ds-census.mjs --base :9000 --widths 1440 --themes light,dark --settle 5000`, 9 routes; `census-after.json`). It reads exactly as pass 1 did: consumer box-shadow layers 116, backdrop blur 18, looping animations 14 (V1C-02, still awaiting the owner); glass multi-layer elements 154, inset highlights 310, backdrop blur 110, drop-shadow 8, control gradients 22. **Verdict RED**, on glass-owned chrome (O-87, the 10.2.0 repin). The pass added and removed no lighting.

**Frames.** `evidence/DS/value/pass-02/`: 36 frames (9 routes × light/dark × 1440/390), headless real Chrome (`capture.mjs`), served from the working tree on `:9000`. 0 of 36 failed.

**Gates.**
- **Type-check** (`npm run typecheck`: vue-tsc lib/demo/test + tsc e2e): 0 errors ×2.
- **vitest**: 1094/1101 ×2. The 7 failures are the same 7 as pass 1 and HEAD (`ink.test` ×5, `spectrum-luma` C-5, `reka-binding-idiom` NG-6). None touches a changed file. **Not GREEN; pre-existing.**
- **e2e**: 18 specs touching the changed surfaces (113 tests, smoke project, headless, workers 1, against `:9000` with its api). Run 1: 28 failed / 85 passed. Run 2: 29 failed / 84 passed. Listings are in `v2c-gates/`.
  - Every failure that appears in both runs is also in pass 1's HEAD/cure listings, except `o17-easing-composition` ×3. That spec was not in pass 1's set. It fails on a strict-mode count of four `svg` inside glass's `#easing-authoring-0`, and this cure touched only the class of one summary-row `span`. Read as pre-existing, but not proven on HEAD this pass.
  - The one run-2-only failure, `scene-action-contract` D4 "Generate on the desktop branch", fails on the dock's "Toggle action bar" not appearing after `expandDock`. That is the O-88 dock-collapse class, and the test passed in run 1.
  - The directly affected legs are GREEN ×2: the O-18 Extract GRAPHICS leg and the config range leg (light and dark), O-9 Extract instrument face and the three TRUE-EMPTY legs (My Palettes included), O-11 gates 1+2 (every pane, so the new My Palettes port is covered), w12-about-clip ×6, and companion-pane-track-start.
  - **e2e is NOT ×2 GREEN**, because of the pre-existing set.
- **No visual golden was re-baselined. No gate was re-aimed.**

**For the pass-3 critic.**
- The scalar range ink in light is pinned at the 3:1 floor by the saturated Atmosphere well. Judge whether the plum-tinted charcoal reads as the value or as weight.
- The kC row is now a two-line column inside the Extract control strip (138px wide at 390). Check that it does not crowd the dock controls.
- V2C-05, V2C-15, V2C-16 and V1C-02 wait on the owner.
