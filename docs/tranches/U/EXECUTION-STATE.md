# U — EXECUTION-STATE (the wall-recovery manifest)

**Purpose.** The durable, repo-committed resume facility for tranche-U execution. A rate-limit /
session wall must lose NOTHING: this file + the run journals + the git tree are sufficient to
resume from any of the three death classes below. **Update this file at every wave launch/close**
(the orchestrator's standing duty); the git history of this file IS the execution timeline.

**Last stamped**: 2026-07-13 (U.W-ADOPT CLOSED `complete_with_misses` — the disease row DECIDED over the
UNFIRED v5 cut; 9 of 10 waves closed, U.W-CLOSE fires next and LAST), by the orchestrating session
`daa7c418-d0bc-4d88-913c-27283e6345eb`.

---

## §1 The three death classes → the recovery per class

1. **API rate-limit wall, session process ALIVE** (the common case; ~5h reset cadence; the
   Fable-credit wall kills fable lanes while opus survives — a distinct sub-class): the in-session
   recovery cron (hourly, currently `:41`) re-fires the continue order when requests flow again.
   Handler: for each §2 run, check its journal freshness — alive → report only; dead →
   `Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId})` (same-session cache replays completed agents; only
   dead agents re-run). **Never burn a batch into a known wall**: if the reset time is known and
   in the future, arm a background timer to reset+2min instead of retrying.
2. **Session process DEAD** (machine sleep, CLI exit, hard crash): the cron dies with it, and
   `resumeFromRunId` is SAME-SESSION-ONLY — a fresh session CANNOT cache-resume. The fresh
   session's recipe: (a) read THIS file + `PROGRESS.md` + the memory ▶▶▶ block; (b) for each
   live run in §2, read `<transcriptDir>/journal.jsonl` (one `{"type":"result"}` line per
   completed agent — the full return values) + `git log --oneline -20 tranche-u` to establish
   what LANDED; (c) audit `git worktree list` for orphaned lane worktrees (uncommitted work is
   recovered per the standing law: audit → patch briefs pinned to the standing worktrees, strip
   isolation — NEVER blind-commit, NEVER discard); (d) hand-author continuation workflows from
   the dead run's script (in §3's scripts dir) minus the journal-proven-done phases.
3. **A single lane dead inside a live run** (StructuredOutput scope-overflow, fable-credit kill):
   the workflow returns `null` for that agent and continues; the orchestrator re-runs via
   `resumeFromRunId` (cached prefix) or a targeted completion brief against the lane's worktree.

## §2 Live runs (stamp on every launch/completion)

  **Next**: **CLOSE — the SOLE remaining wave, fires next and LAST** (the terminal sink UNBLOCKS; 9 of 10
  decided). The zero-drop ledger walk · publish presentation WITH the landed fix · the real-GPU visual
  annex owner-attested · the census ANNEX-7 + A11Y OA-1/OA-2 + u-f12 Pole A/B bracket + **the U-F3 Q14 LCP

  registry §26 W9's Q14 inherits U-F3/F14/F16 — all to the owner. **The v5 probe STAYS STANDING at CLOSE**:
  `git -C ../glass-ui tag --list 'v5*'` each round — on fire mid-CLOSE the unpin [orchestrator-owned] + the

  record `audit/w-adopt/substrate-pin.md`; UNPIN at the v5 tag). The L17 goo-blob→blob consume

  U.W-ADOPT BI-acceptance · the **per-component RTL logical-property audit** → component lanes.
