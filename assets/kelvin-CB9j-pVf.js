It relates the temperature of a theoretical black-body radiator to the color of light it emits. This concept was standardized in the early 20th century and has been widely used in lighting, photography, and color science ever since.</p><hr><h2>Key Characteristics</h2><h3>Unique Features</h3><ol><li><strong>Single-Dimensional</strong>: Unlike most color spaces, Kelvin represents color using just one value—the color temperature.</li><li><strong>Intuitive for Lighting</strong>: The scale aligns with how we perceive warm and cool light sources.</li><li><strong>Physical Basis</strong>: Based on actual physical phenomena rather than perceptual models.</li></ol><h3>Advantages and Disadvantages</h3><h2>Advantages</h2><ul><li>Simple to understand and communicate</li><li>Directly applicable to lighting technology</li><li>Intuitive correlation with perceived warmth/coolness</li><li>Widely used in photography and cinematography</li></ul><h2>Disadvantages</h2><ul><li>Limited to a specific range of colors (blue to yellow-red)</li><li>Cannot represent colors outside the black-body locus</li><li>Not perceptually uniform</li><li>Doesn’t account for green-magenta variations (the “tint” dimension)</li></ul><h3>Color Gamut and Representation</h3><p>The Kelvin color space represents colors along a specific curve in the CIE chromaticity diagram known as the Planckian locus or black-body locus.

Lower values (1000K-3000K) produce warm colors (reddish to yellowish), middle values (4000K-5500K) produce neutral white light, and higher values (6500K-40000K) produce cool colors (bluish white to deep blue).</p><h3>Common Reference Points</h3><ul><li><strong>1900K</strong>: Candlelight</li><li><strong>2700K</strong>: Incandescent/warm white bulb</li><li><strong>3200K</strong>: Halogen lamp/studio “tungsten” lighting</li><li><strong>4100K</strong>: Moonlight</li><li><strong>5000K-5500K</strong>: Direct sunlight at noon/photography “daylight”</li><li><strong>6500K</strong>: Standard daylight (D65)/overcast sky</li><li><strong>15000K-27000K</strong>: Clear blue sky</li></ul><hr><h2>Color Conversions</h2><h3>RGB to Kelvin Conversion</h3><p>Converting from RGB to Kelvin involves finding the closest point on the black-body locus to the given RGB color:</p>",25)),o("div",u,t(i(a)),1),e[3]||(e[3]=o("h3",null,"Kelvin to RGB Conversion",-1)),e[4]||(e[4]=o("p",null,"Converting from Kelvin to RGB uses approximations based on the black-body radiation curve:",-1)),o("div",m,t(i(c)),1),e[5]||(e[5]=r("<hr><h2>Common Applications</h2><p>The Kelvin color space finds extensive use in various industries and fields:</p><ol><li><strong>Photography and Cinematography</strong>: Used for white balance settings to match lighting conditions.</li><li><strong>Lighting Industry</strong>: Specifications for bulbs and LED products to indicate color appearance.</li><li><strong>Display Technology</strong>: Adjusting screen color temperature for different viewing environments or times of day.</li><li><strong>Digital Image Processing</strong>: Color correction and grading in photo and video editing.</li><li><strong>Smart Lighting</strong>: Color temperature adjustment for circadian rhythm support and mood enhancement.</li><li><strong>Astronomy</strong>: Classifying stars based on their color temperature.</li><li><strong>Printing and Graphics</strong>: Understanding and compensating for lighting conditions when evaluating color proofs.</li></ol><p>By leveraging its intuitive relationship to natural and artificial light sources, the Kelvin color space provides a practical framework for controlling and communicating color temperature across numerous applications.</p>",5))]))}};export{k as default};
