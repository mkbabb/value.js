It’s also called <strong>HSB</strong> (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) in some applications—same thing, different name.</p><p>The model is cylindrical: hue is an angle around the wheel, saturation is radial distance from the center axis, and value is height.

In HSV, <code>V=1</code> with varying saturation moves from white to fully saturated color. In HSL, <code>L=0.5</code> with varying saturation moves from gray to fully saturated color.
