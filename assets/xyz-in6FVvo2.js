It was the first mathematically defined color space and represents a pivotal moment in color science. The XYZ system was derived from a series of experiments that mapped how the average human eye responds to different wavelengths of light, creating a standard observer model.</p><h2>Key Characteristics</h2><h3>Unique Features</h3><ol><li><strong>Device Independence</strong>: XYZ values describe colors independent of how they are displayed or captured.</li><li><strong>Complete Color Representation</strong>: Can represent all visible colors, unlike RGB which is limited by its gamut.</li><li><strong>Foundation for Other Spaces</strong>: Serves as the reference space for converting between many other color spaces.</li><li><strong>Standardized White Points</strong>: Uses defined reference whites (D50, D65, etc.) for consistent color representation.</li></ol><h3>Advantages and Disadvantages</h3><h2>Advantages</h2><ul><li>Device-independent</li><li>Encompasses all visible colors</li><li>Mathematical basis for color conversions</li><li>Direct relationship to human vision</li></ul><h2>Disadvantages</h2><ul><li>Not perceptually uniform</li><li>Difficult to interpret visually</li><li>Not directly usable for display or printing</li><li>Abstract components don’t map intuitively to perceived attributes</li></ul><h3>Color Gamut and Representation</h3><p>The XYZ color space can represent all colors visible to the human eye, making it a reference for defining the gamuts of other color spaces. The visible color gamut forms a cone-like shape within the XYZ space.</p><h2>Color Model</h2><h3>Description of Color Components</h3><ol><li><p><strong><code>X</code></strong>: Represents a mix of cone response curves, roughly correlating to red sensitivity.</p></li><li><p><strong><code>Y</code></strong>: Corresponds directly to luminance (brightness), matching the photopic luminosity function of human vision.</p></li><li><p><strong><code>Z</code></strong>: Roughly corresponds to blue sensitivity, though it’s primarily a mathematical construct.</p></li></ol><h3>How Colors are Represented</h3><p>Colors in XYZ space are represented as a point in a three-dimensional space. While Y directly represents brightness, X and Z do not correspond to specific perceptual attributes, making XYZ primarily a mathematical intermediate rather than a creative tool.</p><h3>White Points and Chromatic Adaptation</h3><p>XYZ values depend on the white point (reference white) used:</p><ul><li><strong>D50</strong>: Standard for graphic arts and printing (yellowish white)</li><li><strong>D65</strong>: Standard for digital imaging, representing average daylight (bluish white)</li></ul><p>Converting between white points requires chromatic adaptation, often done with a Bradford transform:</p>',21),D={class:"language-typescript"},X=e("pre",null,[e("code",null,`// D50 to D65 transformation matrix
